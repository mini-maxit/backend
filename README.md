# Development

## Run

To run the appication you need running **docker** with **docker compose**

You also need to have local image of file-storage build and stored. The tag for image should be `maxit/file-storage`. Refer to [documentation](https://github.com/mini-maxit/file-storage?tab=readme-ov-file#build) on how to do it.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

## Migrations

[Atlas](https://atlasgo.io/getting-started#installation) is used for database migrations. You can find migration files in `migrations` folder.

To generate new migration file you can use the following command:

```bash
atlas migrate diff --env gorm
```

To apply migrations to database you can use:

```bash
atlas migrate apply --env gorm --url <database_url>
```


## You might need it

### DUMP=true

If you set `DUMP=true` in the .env file, and start application using provided dev docker compose the app will start with some values present in database. For now this includes:

- Admin user. Email=`admin@admin.com` Password=`adminadmin`
- Teacher user. Email=`teacher@teacher.com` Password=`teacherteacher`
- Student user. Email=`student@student.com` Password=`studentstudent`

### Swagger docs
In order to generate swagger documentation you need to have installed `swag` tool. You can install it using:

```bash
go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
```

Next you can generate swagger documentation using:

```bash
./scripts/update-docs.sh
```

You can access it at `/api/v1/docs` when the application is running.


# Endpoints

You can check automaticaly generated swagger documentation [here](https://mini-maxit.github.io/backend/). Documentation is generated from code comments, so please excuse if there are mistakes.
